# Leetcode-1845-Medium-Class-Optimization-Heap
A not really hard problem, the key is how to code in a class and how to run everything faster. I used a for loop at the first try, which of course failed, and I eliminated the loop by using bisect. However, I am still using a list which is slower, than ----- a constant. Therefore, in the faster solution, the list is kind of converted to a constant.
